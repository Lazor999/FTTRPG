Territory has two sub-values that define the OV (Overall Value) of a territory.

These two values are:
TI (Territorial Influence)
and
SA (Strategical Advantage)

TI makes leveling easier, whereas SA makes it easier to take other territories due to a height advantage or cover advantage.

Usually the two are balanced, however more fortified or mountain-y territories can be favoured in TI or SA, respectively.

OV is calculated by taking the average of the two.

TI is green whereas SA is Orange, and OV is black.

If you manage to capture mutliple territories to surround enemy territories, you automatically capture said territories.

As you can see above, the red (enemy) territories have been surrounded. They will turn green as they have nowhere to go.
