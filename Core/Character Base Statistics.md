Upon creating a character, roll 6 d10s, deciding the base statistics for your Character.

1.) Strength: The brawn. Strength allows you to carry bigger, better weapons, and also packs more power to your attacks. Strength can also be used to carry out difficult, physically taxing tasks.

2.) Endurance: How much hits you can take. Endurance usually goes hand-in-hand with strength considering lengthy Strength tasks usually do Endurance checks, too.
Endurance allows you to run faster, longer, and do more taxing actions.
(1 endurance = 2 meter run length per turn)

3.) Dexterity: How quick you are. Increases your Turn Action modifier, allowing you to take more actions per turn and it also increases your capability to dodge.

4.) Willpower: The brain. Increases Hacking capabilities, awareness, and strategical capabilities. Also makes you persistent.

5.) Charisma: How convincing you are. Increases capability of speech, how convincing your lies are, or truths, for that matter; And also allows you to convince Stressed Out Teammates and calm them down. Also increases your Stress Point cap by 2 per Charisma point.
You have 20 base Stress Points.

6.) Wisdom: How much you know and are capable of knowing. Purely a magical stat.

After going through Base Statistics, you are allowed to take the following traits per stat with a roll of 7 or more:

Strength 7+:

1 - Brute

You have the capability to dual wield any weapon within your capability of wielding normally. If you have 8 strength and have 2 8-strength weapons, that means you can carry both at once.

2 - Naturally Enduring

Lengthy Strength checks do not require Endurance checks anymore. Useful for if your Endurance is low.

3 - Melee Expert

You are a master at Melee. Any Melee damage dealt is increased by a multiplier of 1.5, rounded upwards.

Endurance 7+:

1 - Battle Hardened
You know how to push yourself to the limit. Running does not use a Turn Action.

2 - Punching Bag
It's just a flesh wound. Because you've taken bigger hits before, you do not lose Sanity nor Movement Points for being or seeing someone else be in a critical state of health.

Dexterity 7+:

1 - Slim
You unlock the capability to Burst, which means you can use double your Movement points twice per Mission, for one turn.

2 - Acrobat
Add +2 to dodge checks at all times, even if Area Of Effect.

3 - Sleight of hand
Reloading does not take a Turn Action.

Willpower 7+:

1 - Veteran
You are capable of handling everything, mentally. Stress no longer affects you.

2 - Hacker
Hacking is your second nature. Hacking does not take a Turn Action, and you can multi-task while hacking (allowing you to defend yourself without cancelling the process.)

Charisma 7+:

1 - Sociopath
You are forced to lie when you take the word, however you do not need Charisma Saves.

2 - Psychopath
Seeing other people in a state of distress or pain does nothing to you. It might even reduce your stress. Roll a 1d2 everytime someone becomes Stressed out or hurt, and the result decreases your Stress.

Wisdom 7+:

1 - Elementalist
Use a secondary element alongside your first.

2 - Healer
Healing takes no Energy nor does it need a check.

3 - Reaper
Every kill *you* make increases your Magic Mastery by 1.
