Stress works in various ways.
Any character starts with 0/20 Stress Points. These stress points increase on various actions, and can be regulated by taking rests between missions, or getting someone with high Charisma to calm you down.

Charisma checks are to be done in situations where you are being calmed down, which means you have to roll a 1d20 + Charisma, and the success chance is decided by the DM's look on the situation.

When Stress points hit the maximum threshold, several things can be decided by a die.
roll a d4 and refer to the Stress Table.

When the turn counter is over, you return to normal and your Stress Points counter resets.

## Stress Table

1: You are panicking. For 3 turns, you will move into random positions regardless of hazards or enemies.

2: You don't know who's who. For 3 turns, take a shot at a random unit regardless of if it's a friend or foe.

3: You're scared. Cower down for 3 turns, increasing armor class by 3 but you cannot do anything.

4: You're going insane! For 5 turns, do a random action described by 1, 2, or 3.

## Energy

Energy is a meter most commonly used for the [[Mage]], however every class has the Energy Meter.

Every class has 20 energy, and the only thing that drains it (except for [[Mage]]) are mission objectives and hacking actions.

If you deplete all your energy, you become [[Tired]] and you gain 2 Stress Points.

You can take a turn to Rest, granting you 5 energy. You can only Rest if you have done nothing in the turn. The [[Mage]] can rest using a Turn Action instead.
